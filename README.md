# Project Tweety

Not really much going on here. This is just a playground to try out some ideas and some new things
that I find cool or interesting.

The only real Pathway/Guideline that I am following
is [this Flutter Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/flutter).

Ideas to work on, are logged as [Issues](https://github.com/EuanScott/project-tweety/issues) in the
Github repo.

_Why a Flutter project_, you may ask? Well that's because at the time of writing this doc, I just
came off a Flutter project and thought it would be cool to explore some things that I wasn't able to
do on that project.

## Development Style

Historically, I've always used the [Git FLow](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-flow) approach
to software development, in particular Mobile App development. I have however, of late come
across [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) and I think I may just be
giving that a try. After all, this project isn't being worked on in a big corporate environment.

## Setup & Usage

Nothing fancy here, I'm just following the "Get started" guide on
the [Official Flutter Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
