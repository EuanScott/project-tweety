# Dynamic Form

The idea with undertaking this concept of a dynamic form is to try making something that is reusable and scalable for
use in a larger scale application.

So why and not in whatever project I am working on at Entelect? Simple, I don't have anything like this at work. I've thought that this could be something
cool that I can work and on thought I'd give it a try.

Once I've proved the viability of something like this in a Flutter Application, I can do one of 2 things with it.
1) I can see about having this be data driven from some kind of service call (future enhancement)
2) I can take this to my team. Maybe they can replicate this in the React website that they are working on.

At this time, there is no need for something like this within my space as a mobile developer. I do however see this as something cool to do in the future, when required.

## Development Style
[_TODO_, either here in this readme, or using something like [dartdoc](https://pub.dev/packages/dartdoc)]
